# Conway's "Game of Life"

---

In 1970, John Conway, a British mathemetician, created this 
zero-player game to simulate how cells act and evolve.

---

In this project I have recreated the game with these three rules. 

    1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
    2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
    3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly,
        all other dead cells stay dead.

---

The game is said to be played out on an infinite grid, but for
simulation purposes I have made the edges of the visibile map dead
cells so it's easy to visualize and easy for a computer to run it.

# Motivation
I was super excited to do this project because it was a real glimpse into actually programming something functional. It was a chance to stretch beyond just web development.

# Tech/Frameworks
I realized it would be a little messy but I decided to try and do this with just JS, HTML, CSS, and not do a react app. 

# Future Improvements
If I had some more time, I would have really liked to clean this up a bit by setting up more components and organizing my code better. I realized, by the last day of the project, that my code was not as clean as I wanted it to be.

# Use
If you want to see the app in action, just clone the repo and run index.html
